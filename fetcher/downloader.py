"""Sequential model downloads + progress on the ComfyUI websocket.

A queue plus a single worker thread (started lazily). Each job writes to a ``.part`` file then
``os.replace`` at the end. Progress is pushed through ``send_sync`` (throttled). Cancellation
uses one ``threading.Event`` per job, tested on every chunk.

**Resume**: the ``.part`` survives a cancellation, a dropped connection or a truncated
transfer, and the next attempt picks up where it stopped (``Range`` header). On a multi-GB
checkpoint that is the difference between resuming and starting over. The ``.part`` name
carries a fingerprint of the URL: two different sources sharing a filename can never end up
mixed inside the same temporary file.
