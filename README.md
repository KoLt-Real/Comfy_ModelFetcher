# Comfy Model Fetcher

A top-bar button for ComfyUI that reads the **Markdown notes** of the open workflow, extracts
the models it needs, tells you what is already on disk, and downloads what is missing — into
the right folder.

Most ComfyUI templates ship a *"Model Link(s)"* note listing every checkpoint, VAE and text
encoder the graph expects. This plugin turns that note into a working install: one click,
correct destinations, progress bars, and gated-model handling.

It also fixes the other half of the problem: when you **already own** a model but keep it in a
subfolder, the workflow's loader still points at the category root and fails. The **Relink**
button rewrites the node instead of downloading a second copy.

## Features

### Reads the workflow
- Parses `MarkdownNote` / `Note` nodes of the open graph, **subgraphs included**.
- Understands both note styles: `**checkpoints**`-style bold sections, and the
  `📂 ComfyUI/ → models/ → …` **"Model Storage Location" tree** (the tree wins — it is the
  only one that expresses subfolders such as `checkpoints/SDXL`).
- Recognises direct-download links: HuggingFace `/resolve/`, Civitai `/api/download/`,
  GitHub `/releases/download/`, or any URL ending in a model extension
  (`.safetensors .ckpt .pt .pth .bin .sft .gguf .onnx .pkl .pt2`).
- A **badge on the button** shows how many models are still missing, and refreshes on every
  workflow load, tab switch and finished download.

### Tells you what you already have
Each model is classified against your disk — every folder registered for the category,
**including the extra roots from `extra_model_paths.yaml`**, scanned recursively:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✓ **Installed** | the loader finds it under its plain filename — the file sits at the root of *one* of the category roots (main folder or any extra path), with the right size |
| ≈ **Likely duplicate** | same filename, same size, but in a **subfolder** — the loader would not find it, so the row offers **Relink** |
| ⚠ **Same name, different size** | same filename, different content — probably another version |
| ⬇ **Missing** | not on disk |
| ? **Unknown destination** | the note does not say where it goes — pick a folder yourself |

Sizes come from a `HEAD` request (HuggingFace's `x-linked-size`, else `Content-Length`), so
"likely duplicate" means *same name **and** same byte count*.

### Relink — fix the graph instead of re-downloading
ComfyUI templates point at the root of a category (`flux1-dev.safetensors`), but you may keep
the file in `checkpoints/Flux/`. On a **Likely duplicate**, press **Relink**:

- every loader widget in the workflow that points at that filename is rewritten to the real
  relative path (`Flux/flux1-dev.safetensors`), **subgraphs included**;
- same-named files from a *different* category are left alone — the widget's own value list
  is used to tell them apart;
- the button becomes a green **✓ Linked** pill, the row turns to **🔗 Linked**, and the footer
  reminds you to **save the workflow** (the change lives in the graph, not on disk);
- the state is **read back from the graph** on every render, so an undo, a reload or another
  workflow shows the button again — nothing is cached or guessed;
- if no node in the workflow uses that file, the button is disabled and says so.

Each row carries its two decisions on separate lines — **Link to** … *Relink* above,
**Save to** … *Download* below — so every button sits next to the field that drives it.

**Several copies on disk?** When the same filename sits in more than one subfolder, **Link to**
becomes a menu and Relink points where you tell it to. It opens on the copy the workflow
already uses, falling back to the first same-size one in alphabetical order, and only ever
lists real choices:
copies whose size contradicts the source are left out — those are another version of the model,
which is also why a size mismatch never gets a Relink button at all — and copies sharing a
relative path under two roots count once, since ComfyUI would load the same file either way.
With a single copy, **Link to** simply shows its path.

Each entry says **where** the copy lives rather than repeating the filename: the subfolder, and
the root as soon as the copies span more than one — `models/unet · Minimax` next to
`models/diffusion_models · MiniMax`. Two roots ending the same way are dug into until they read
differently, and the full path stays one hover away.

![The Link to menu open on a likely duplicate: the same file exists twice, once under
models/diffusion_models and once under models/unet, and each entry is named by its root and its
subfolder. Above it, a row already relinked shows a green Linked pill; below, a missing model
has no Link to line at all — only Save to and Download. The footer reminds you to save the
workflow](docs/ui-relink.png)

### Downloads
- Sequential queue with a single worker, **live progress** (bytes, total, speed) pushed over
  the ComfyUI websocket.
- **Cancel** at any time: a queued job disappears instantly, an active one stops at the next
  chunk. Re-queueing a job that is still running is handled correctly.
- **Resumable.** Downloads go to a `.part` file that survives a cancel, a dropped connection
  or a truncated transfer; the next attempt sends a `Range` header and continues where it
  stopped. Losing a connection at 95 % of a 20 GB checkpoint no longer means starting over.
  The `.part` name carries a fingerprint of the source URL, so bytes from two different
  sources that happen to share a filename can never end up in the same file. If the server
  ignores `Range`, the download simply restarts — correctness never depends on it.
- Renames atomically on success — an interrupted download never leaves a corrupt model in
  place. Disk-full, 404 and incomplete transfers are reported per row (only a full disk
  discards the partial file, since keeping it would make things worse).
- **Choose the destination**: when a category has several roots (main folder +
  `extra_model_paths.yaml`), a *location* menu lets you pick; roots missing on the machine are
  greyed out. Entries are labelled with just enough of the path to tell them apart — two
  installs that both end in `models/clip` show up as `ComfyUI_MAIN/models/clip` and
  `AI/models/clip`, not twice the same thing. Long paths keep both ends visible
  (`ComfyUI_MAIN/…/text_encoders`) and the full path stays on hover. ComfyUI also registers
  `output/<category>` for each model type (so models written by save nodes can be loaded
  again); those stay scanned for duplicates but are never offered as a destination. The
  subfolder field suggests existing folders and accepts a **new** one (created on download).
  Empty = category root.
- The server only ever accepts a folder actually registered for that category, and confines
  the final path inside it.

### Gated models (HuggingFace token)
- When a model returns 401, the popup explains the whole path in plain language: free account →
  accept the repo licence (direct links to the exact repos) → create a *Read* token → paste it.
- The token is applied immediately and saved once in ComfyUI's `user` folder
  (`cf_mf_hf_token.txt`, mode `0600`), then reloaded on later starts.
- `HF_TOKEN` / `HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN` from the environment always win.
- A **Remove** button deletes the saved token (shown only when the plugin is the one that
  saved it — a token exported in your shell is left untouched).
- The token is **only ever sent to HuggingFace hosts**. A workflow note pointing at any other
  server never receives your credentials.
- Token validation and HuggingFace file sizes go through `huggingface_hub` (which ships with
  ComfyUI), so mirrors and enterprise endpoints (`HF_ENDPOINT`) work and the HF protocol stays
  upstream's problem. Other hosts keep the plain `HEAD` path.

### Per-workflow state
Your choices in the popup (location, subfolder, ticked boxes) survive closing it, but stay
attached to **the workflow you made them in** — several open workflows never contaminate each
other. If the popup is open while you switch tabs, it re-analyses the new graph.

### The button itself
Docked in the top bar by default; **drag it** anywhere to float it, drop it back on the bar to
re-dock. Position and docked state persist across sessions.

## Install

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/KoLt-Real/ComfyUI-ModelFetcher.git
```

Restart ComfyUI. That's it — **no dependencies to install** (it only uses `requests` and
`aiohttp`, both already required by ComfyUI) and **no build step** (the frontend is plain
JS/CSS).

Requires ComfyUI with the current frontend (subgraph support) and Python 3.10+.

To update:

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-ModelFetcher && git pull
```

This package registers **no nodes** — it only adds the button and its HTTP routes. If anything
goes wrong at import time it logs and steps aside; it can never prevent ComfyUI from starting.

---

## Usage

1. Open a workflow that carries a *Model Link(s)* note (all official templates do).
2. Click **Models** in the top bar. The popup lists every model, grouped by destination folder.
3. Missing models are pre-ticked → **Download selected**, or use the per-row **Download**.
4. On a *Likely duplicate*, press **Relink**, then **save the workflow**.

---

## HTTP API

All routes live under `/cf_mf` and are registered on ComfyUI's own server.

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /cf_mf/analyze` | notes → models + status + remote sizes + per-category destinations |
| `POST /cf_mf/count` | light count of missing models (drives the button badge, no network) |
| `POST /cf_mf/download` | queue jobs (destination resolved server-side) |
| `POST /cf_mf/cancel` | cancel one job (`id`) or all (`all: true`) |
| `GET /cf_mf/status` | active + pending job ids |
| `GET/POST /cf_mf/token` | token state / save-and-validate a token |
| `POST /cf_mf/token/clear` | delete the saved token |

Progress is pushed on the ComfyUI websocket as `cf_mf.progress`, `cf_mf.done`, `cf_mf.error`.

## Architecture

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `fetcher/notes_parser.py` | pure parsing, no ComfyUI import — testable standalone |
| `fetcher/scanner.py` | category resolution (`folder_paths`), disk index, classification, relink target |
| `fetcher/remote.py` | remote size — `huggingface_hub` on HF, plain HEAD elsewhere; cached (sizes forever, errors briefly) |
| `fetcher/downloader.py` | queue + worker, resumable `.part` writes, websocket progress |
| `fetcher/routes.py` | the `/cf_mf/*` API; blocking I/O runs off the event loop |
| `fetcher/hf_token.py` | token storage, validation, and the HuggingFace-only auth header |
| `web/main.js` | top-bar button, badge, note collection |
| `web/popup.js` | the panel: rows, destinations, downloads, token, per-workflow state |
| `web/relink.js` | reads and rewrites loader widgets in the open graph |

Check the parser against a folder of workflow templates without running ComfyUI:

```bash
python -m fetcher._validate_parser <folder-of-workflow-json>
```

## Tests

```bash
./tests/run_all.sh
```

The Python and JavaScript suites need nothing beyond what ComfyUI already provides. The browser
suite needs Playwright (`pip install playwright && playwright install chromium`) and is skipped
cleanly when it is absent, as is anything else that cannot run in the current environment.

They cover the status classification (proven equivalent over its full truth table), relink
target resolution, the security boundaries (token host allowlist, path-traversal confinement),
model-id uniqueness, the remote-size cache, the downloader's concurrency races, the API
contract and that handlers stay off the event loop, plus the popup itself in a real browser —
Relink, per-workflow state, error rows and the token panel.

The JS and browser tests copy the actual `web/` sources into a temporary fake-ComfyUI tree at
run time, so they always test the current code. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the invariants
those tests protect.
